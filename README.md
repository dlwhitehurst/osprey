# osprey

This README describes how to quickly create a REST API and host it locally requiring only a RAML 1.0
specification. The response can ONLY be a static example. This however, can be very helpful for local
development where an external JSON REST API will be called actually in Production. The Osprey Mock
Service can be run locally on your OS as a service listener. It could also be run as a Docker container
that could be started and stopped using Docker for your local development.

The Osprey Mock Service is maintained as open source here:

[https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/osprey-mock-service](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/osprey-mock-service)

To experiment and run this Osprey implementation example, first clone this software repository or fork it if
you have suggestions for improvement.

    git clone https://github.com/dlwhitehurst/osprey.git

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Osprey Mock Service you must use the Node Package Manager (NPM) and either install
the service globally (quickest) or locally within your project directory. Do note that local installation
requires the use of an application Javascript module. If you install globally, you can implement your own
mocks anywhere using just a RAML specification.
